# BurgerBar-Website
Project of Burger Bar website is based on **html, css and bootstrap**. 

I work on it to get expirience and more practise in frontend development.

It contains:
* Home page with impressive photo corousel, 
* responsive Menu, which might make you hungry,
* Bars locations with reordering effect when resizing,
* modal Newsletter form (click Sign up here!).
